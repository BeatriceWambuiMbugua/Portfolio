        <p>Hello, I am Beatrice Wambui.
            I am a creative writer, software developer, 
            and mental health advocate. 
        </p>

                    <h3>Creative Writing</h3>
                    <p>In normal spaces, I am a wallflower. However, in the writing world, I am bold with big dick energy. 
                        Someone has referred me to the Queen of Wands, meaning I have a way with writing. 
                        Writing gives me the power to dominate peopleâ€™s minds and write about the words that are always left unsaid.</p>

                    <h3>Software Developer</h3>
                    <p>In the world of technology, I walk shoulders' high because 
                        of being the best in software development. I have mastered several languages
                        that set me apart as well as my discipline in delivering the best services. 
                        Therefore, you can call me; <strong>"The Soft Guru"</strong>.

                    <h3>Mental Health Advocate</h3>
                    <p>You matter. Don't Give Up. You are not alone. 
                        As a mental health activist, I practice mindfulness and intentionality when talking to people struggling with mental health disorders. 
                        I create awareness through social media and engage different personality in normalizing 
                        struggles.
